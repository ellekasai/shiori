 	<li>Five tips to improve English Writing (<em>watch?v=GgkRoYPLhts)</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not use Contractions (could't -&gt; could not)</li>
 	<li>Avoid there is/there are (There are many issues that students face at university -&gt; many students face issues at university)</li>
 	<li>Avoid the usage of really, a lot of, so, very (Bill 399 is <del>really</del> controversial , life is <del>very hard</del> difficult)</li>
 	<li>Use active voice more often than passive voice to stress the actor( Healthcare reforms was implemented by Obama -&gt; Obama implemented healthcare reforms)</li>
 	<li>Use strong verbs rather than weak verbs, consider the noun whether can be replaced by a powerful verb(made an objection -&gt; objected, did an audit -&gt; audited)</li>
</ul>
</li>
