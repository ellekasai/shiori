<h4>Introduction</h4>
<em>"the Desired Preparedness "</em>
<blockquote>In my mind, the best way to look at this( earning awesome grades ) is to envision the final goal<strong> not as the tangible reward</strong> - the grade - but rather as<strong> the state of being you want to achieve</strong>.</blockquote>
<em>“Ideas are just a multiplier of execution.” ——Derek Sivers , CD Baby founder </em>
<blockquote>You’ll be a lot better off if you just read one step of this book and <strong>put it into action</strong> than if you read the whole thing and proceed to do jack.</blockquote>

<h4>Step 4 Planning like a General</h4>
&nbsp;
<h5><em>"Quick Planning, More Time Getting Stuff Done"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Logically, this means that you want to be in Robot Mode as much as you possibly can during your work sessions. Steps 7 and 8 will go into detail on how to upgrade yourself to be a better robot, but in this step we’ll talk about how to utilize Planning Mode effectively so you don’t have to spend much time in it. In short,<strong> the best way to do this is to get your planning done up front.</strong></p>

<h5><em>"Plan Out Your Entire Education"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As a freshman, I created an Excel spreadsheet that mapped out all the classes I would take over the following eight semesters.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong> major, electives and credits</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Each time I changed plans, I always made sure to update the spreadsheet. Doing this ensured that I always knew what my overall graduation plan was. It also kept me mindful of when I could sign up for classes, which I did as early as possible each semester.</p>

<h5><em>"Plan Your Week on Sunday"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sunday is a prime choice, because it’s right before you get back into the swing of things for the week.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You’ll probably have academic tasks, and you’ll also have non-academic tasks.</p>

<h5><em>"Grouping your tasks by context"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">managing your work by context : <strong>High thought-intensity work</strong> and <strong>Low thought-intensity work</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> By planning ahead, you can block off a few concentrated hours to take care of all these easier tasks - leaving longer time periods open for the focused, high-intensity work that’s more valuable to you in the long run.</p>

<h5><em>"Create a Daily Plan"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">However, you can’t plan everything out on a Sunday. You can either do this first thing in the morning, or the night before.(Morning Routine and Evening Routine)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Firstly, Prioritize your daily list. By putting the most important tasks first, I’m able to get the best results possible, even though I’m not reaching 100% list completion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What’s “important?” Think about your tasks in terms of:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">• What will get you closest to achieving your goals</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">• What will prevent your life from spiraling into utter chaos, destruction, and the rise of Beelzebub himself</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">• What will require the most willpower to complete</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Willpower - is an especially crucial consideration, as willpower is a finite resource.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Estimate the amount of time it’ll take to complete each task, then add up all the estimates and come up with a total time commitment for the list, which I’ll write at the bottom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’ll use that total time estimate to come up with an end goal for my work day. Doing this helps to externalize my motivation to complete my work by creating time pressure that exists outside of my brain.</p>

<h5><em>"Try Timeboxing"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Enter timeboxing. This means actually scheduling specific blocks of time for each task on your daily list.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You can simply try using it on one particular project that you know you’ve been procrastinating on. You can also use timeboxing when you’re faced with a project for which you’re not feeling a whole lot of clear direction.  Creating a timebox can motivate you to spend that time at least trying to make some progress.</p>

<h5><em>"Thy Fudge Ratio"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Humans are really bad at accurately predicting how long it will take to do things, and this is due to something called the planning fallacy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There’s actually a good way of accounting for this problem (unlike many other cognitive biases), and <strong>that’s to base your prediction on a broad view of the task, rather than all the individual components.</strong> When you do this, you can<strong> compare it to similar tasks</strong> that have already been completed in the real world, and make your estimate based on the amount of time those tasks actually took. As you do more and more work, you’ll have more and more data to pull from when doing this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Pavlina’s Fudge Ratio acknowledges the Planning Fallacy and offers up a simple process for fixing it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">1. Write down a list of tasks you need to do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2. Put an “off-the-cuff” time estimate on each one.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">3. As you finish tasks, write down the actual amount of time they took.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4. Divide the actual task time by your estimate to get your Fudge Ratio.</p>

<h5><em>"Use the Captain America Method to Break Down Projects"</em></h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Planning shouldn’t stop at the weekly or daily level. Individual projects should be broken into steps and prioritized as well - and your goal here should be to create a list of steps that are actionable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then, one day, I decided to draw out a specific plan detailing exactly how I’d tackle my emails. I categorized each message, then created steps based on which messages were of the highest priority. Then, I forced myself to go through my inbox in the exact order the steps dictated.</p>
